# TBD Developer Docs Sitemap

This repository is the roadmap for our new docs sitemap. Each folder name and file within is open for suggestions and changes. The order of the folders is alphabetal not how it will be laid out on the site. This repo is phase one and soon the doc copy will live elsewhere once we've established where our docs will live.

## Current Status

Hackmd's are being created for each file in the sitemap and we'll be tagging folks to add in their ideas and copy to these files so we can get started laying the groundwork for our new docs.

## Collaborative HackMD Files for each File

## SITEMAP GENERAL
Edit file names, add additional files, and/or change the order.
