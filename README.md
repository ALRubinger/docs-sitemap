# TBD Developer Docs Sitemap
This repository is the roadmap for our new docs sitemap. Each folder name and file within is open for suggestions and changes. The order of the folders is alphabetal not how it will be laid out on the site. This repo is phase one and soon the doc copy will live elsewhere once we've established where our docs will live.
