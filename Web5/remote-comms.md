# Needs to get remote comms (Shorter: “Remote Comms” what does that even mean)

- Tenant gating (people can’t bomb the DWN servers)
- Limits on account storage (so people can’t store unlimited bytes)
- Remote can be done with additional installation and hosting requirements - user installs a DWN somewhere public
- But the no-installation experience is gonna take OSE
- To spin this off and return to it by end of week - see if we can assemble a jank remote capable solution with no installation requirement for the user
