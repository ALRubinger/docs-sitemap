*This is not really a template, but a rough draft of our contributing page I wanted to add in. A lot of copy on this page is from an [example](https://refine.dev/docs/contributing/) contributing file I like. Please edit and add more to this file when the time comes to add in copy! Many of the links are broken because I'm not sure if we have or want pages for them.*

## Commit convention

Commit messages are essential to keep everything clear. We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to keep our commit messages consistent and easy to understand.

```
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

Examples:

-   `feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs`
-   `fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string`
-   `docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG`

## Git branches

-   `next` â€“ contains next version (1.x.0), most likely you would want to create a PR to this branch (do we want to do this?)
-   `main` â€“ current stable version

## Running in development mode

Explain how if we plan to / want to.

### Starting documentation in watch mode (Is this true?)

Our documentation is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). To start it in development mode, run:

```bash
cd documentation
npm install
DISABLE_DOCGEN=true npm run start
```

## Running tests
